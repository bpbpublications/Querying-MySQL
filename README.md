## About the Book
This book will take you on an interactive journey to understand SQL querying from the most basic to the most expert level utilising a variety of SQL techniques to extract relevant insights from your MySQL databases.

The first section of this book serves as an introduction to the fundamental ideas of both SQL and MySQL. It then walks readers through constructing queries using simple and then more sophisticated table joins and gradually more advanced data filtering to produce advanced queries based on a range of SQL techniques. The reader will better understand MySQL database analysis by mastering the fundamentals of SQL computation, relational logic, and data grouping and aggregation. SQL fundamentals such as query formatting, constructing subqueries, generating derived tables, joining and filtering tables, etc., are also covered. In addition, the book explains how to do rolling analysis, study time-series data, and manage huge and complex MySQL datasets.

After completing the book, readers can create their methods for analysing relational MySQL datasets and gaining the needed insights.
